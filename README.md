# Task Description:
### As part of the interview process, we have prepared a technical challenge to evaluate your Kotlin skills.The challenge involves developing an app screen that consumes a RESTful API and displays user data in a card with horizontal scrolling. Each scroll should display 10 cards.

1. Kotlin Configuration:
- Set up the development environment with Kotlin.
- Configure the environment to ensure proper functioning of Kotlin.
  
2. API Consumption:
- Implement the necessary code in Kotlin to fetch data from the provided API.
  
3. Implementation:
- Follow the design of the user interface HERE
- The API for this challenge is HERE
- Create cards containing the data.
- The cards should be displayed in groups of 10 cards.
- Implement horizontal scrolling to see all the cards in the group.
  
4. Additional Implementation:
- Provide options for editing and deleting user data in each card.
- Apply appropriate styling and ensure responsive design.
  
5. Best Practices:
- Follow Kotlin best best practices for project structure, and code organization.
- Document any limitations or assumptions you encounter during development.
- Store your code in a publicly accessible GitHub repository

6. Submit your work:
Once you are done, send the repository link HERE

## Conclusion:
We expect you to complete this coding task by using Kotlin to develop a single screen app that
consumes the API. This task will help us evaluate your ability to configure Kotlin , work with
APIs, replicate designs of user interfaces, and implement desirable behaviors.
